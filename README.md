## **Introduction**
**Plex** is an **Animation, VFX and Games pipeline** managing important workflows during production.
Its core is a flexible and independent system for small to mid-sized projects and companies.
The basic idea is to handle the file and folder structure, setup basic rules and guide the workflow to allow collaboration in a complex production environment. Plug and play.

> Intuitively guiding the input and output of users to overcome problems and achieve goals.
> Now you have a good game ... or pipeline.
