## **Introduction**
**Plex** is an **Visual Effects, Animation and Games pipeline** that manages critical workflows during production.
Its core is a flexible and self-contained system for small to medium sized projects and companies.
The basic idea is to manage the file and folder structure, set the ground rules and manage the workflow to allow collaboration in a complex production environment. Plug and play.

> Intuitively guiding the input and output of users to overcome problems and achieve goals.
> Now you have a good game ... or pipeline.
